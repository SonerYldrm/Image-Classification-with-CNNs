# Image-Classification-with-CNNs

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used in data science domain especially for computer vision and image classification tasks. I implemented a CNN with Keras library to perform a binary classification task. I tried to explain the concepts of each step in a convolutional neural network and the theory behind them.

The images are taken from Caltech101 dataset:
